   *  OpenMappedFile()
   *
   *  Summary:
   *    Opens a file fork with the privileges requested for use as

   *
   *  Discussion:
   *    The OpenMappedFile function opens the fork specified by the
   *    forkNameLength and forkName parameters of the file specified by
   *    the ref parameter and returns a BackingFileID in the backingFile
   *    parameter. You can pass the BackingFileID to other routines which
   *    accept a BackingFileID as an input parameter. The privileges
   *    parameter specifies what operations you want to perform on the
   *    mapped file fork. Programs can request either kCanReadMappedFile
   *    privileges, or both kCanReadMappedFile and kCanWriteMappedFile
   *    privileges. To disable Process Manager tracking of the mapped
   *    file fork and its mapped file views, you may also request
   *    kNoProcessMappedFile privileges.
   *
   *  Parameters:

   *  Discussion:
   *    The FSpOpenMappedFile function opens the fork specified by the
   *    mapResFork parameter of the file specified by the spec parameter
   *    and returns a BackingFileID in the backingFile parameter. You can

   *
   *  Summary:
   *    Creates and opens a scratch file with the privileges requested
   *    for use as backing storage.
   *
   *  Discussion:
   *    The OpenMappedScratchFile function creates a file with the size
   *    specified by the fileSize parameter on the volume specified by
   *    the volume parameter. If kFSInvalidVolumeRefNum is passed as the
   *    volume parameter, the system code will choose the location of the
   *    file. OpenMappedScratchFile then opens the file and returns a
   *    BackingFileID in the backingFile parameter. You can pass the
   *    BackingFileID to other routines which accept a BackingFileID as
   *    an input parameter. The privileges parameter specifies what
   *    operations you want to perform on the mapped file fork. Programs
   *    can request either kCanReadMappedFile privileges, or both
   *    kCanReadMappedFile and kCanWriteMappedFile privileges. To disable
   *    Process Manager tracking of the mapped file fork and its mapped
   *    file views, you may also request kNoProcessMappedFile privileges.
   *    The data for a scratch file is only valid in an open mapped file
   *    view. When a mapped file view is first created for a scratch file
   *    with MapFileView, data on disk is not paged into memory. When
   *    that mapped file view is unmapped with UnmapFileView, changes are
   *    not flushed from memory to disk.
   *
   *  Parameters:
   *
   *    volume:
   *      The volume where scratch file should be created or
   *      kFSInvalidVolumeRefNum to let the system choose the volume.
   *
   *    fileSize:
   *      The size of the scratch file.
   *
   *    privileges:

   *      Receives a BackingFileID which you can use to access the mapped

   *    specified by the backingFile parameter. All mapped file views
   *    using the BackingFileID must be closed before closing the mapped
   *    file fork. If the BackingFileID is for a scratch file created
   *    with OpenMappedScratchFile, the scratch file is deleted by
   *    CloseMappedFile after it is closed.

   *  Parameters:
   *

   *
   *  Discussion:
   *    The MapFileView function creates a mapped file view into the
   *    mapped file fork specified by the backingFile parameter.
   *    MapFileView returns a FileViewID in the theView parameter. You
   *    can pass the FileViewID to other routines which accept a
   *    FileViewID as an input parameter. The backingBase and
   *    backingLength parameters specify what part of the mapped file
   *    fork will be mapped to memory. The access parameter specifies the
   *    allowable access to the memory in a mapped file view. The
   *    guardLength parameter specifies the size, in bytes, of the
   *    excluded logical address ranges to place adjacent to each end of
   *    the mapped file view. The options parameter specifies the desired
   *    characteristics of the mapped file view. The viewBase parameter,
   *    as an optional input, specifies the requested viewBase. The
   *    backingBase parameter must be a whole multiple of the logical
   *    page size. If kMapEntireFork is passed as backingLength, accesses
   *    past the mapped file fork's logical end-of-file will not cause
   *    exceptions, but will have undefined behavior. Only accesses up to
   *    viewLength should be considered valid. The starting address of
   *    the mapped file view is returned in the viewBase parameter. The
   *    length of the mapped file view is returned in the viewLength
   *    parameter.
   *
   *  Parameters:
   *
   *    backing\file
   *      The mapped file fork to create a mapped file view from.
   *
